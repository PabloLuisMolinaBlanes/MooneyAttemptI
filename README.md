# SolPFAttemptI (not final version)

SolPF is an app which aims to be a self-contained ledger for personal finances. It includes basic statistics, models, and a simple personal-use ledger.

# Disclaimer

**This is a test, proof-of-concept project, and not meant to be a final product** (although it may be deployed). **The functionality and the codebase may change erratically and suddenly.**

## Features

* Calculation of basic statistical measures (max, min, mean, median, etc.).
* Distinction of money transactions by category. (Rent, Salary, Entertainment, etc.)
* Multiple graphs representing in an easy-to-visualize manner financial data and insights.

## Technologies

So far, I will be using:

* Vite (as the frontend server)
* React with Typescript (as the main frontend codebase language)
* TailwindCSS (as my CSS framework)
* Node.JS with Express.JS (Backend web server to communicate with services)
* Flask (Backend services server)
* Python (Where most services will be implemented in, to execute calculations and create graphs)
